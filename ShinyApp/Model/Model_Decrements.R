# Inputs
 # Data frames:(can be selected from the RunControl file.)   
 # - Mortality table:    by age (later we may want mortality rates change over time also). Var name qxm
 # - Termination table:  by age and ea. Var name qxt
 # - Disability table:   by age. Var name qxd
 # - Retirement table:   by age. Var name qxr. Will be coerced to single retirement age for now.
 # - Disability mortality table: by age.
# Parameters:
 # - r.min, r.max
 # - r.yos
 # - range_age, range_ea 
# Outputs
 # decrement   


# Notes
# 1) For now, we assume all decrement rates do not change over time.  
# 2) Now assume the decrement tables contain multiple decrement rates(probabilities) rather than single decrement rates.
#    If the decrement tables provide single decrement rates, we need to convert them to multiple decrement rates in a consistent way.   
#    At least for TPAF, the multiple decrement rates (probabilities) are provided in AV.  

## Timing of decrements
 # Time period t is defined as the time interval [t, t+1), closed at the beginning and open at the end. 
 # Assume retirement is independent of all other risks and occurs at the beginning of time period t, with the probability qxr(t).
 # Individual's status at t becomes "retired" immediately after the risk of retirement is realized at the beginning of t.    
 # The occurence of death, disability and termination follow UUD over period t. 
 # payment of retirement benefit occurs at the beginning of t. Hence all retirees will recieve benefit at least once, at the very moment when
 # they become retirees. 
 # Given the assumptions above, it follows that (' indicates single decrement rates)
 # qe = qe'
 # qt = qt'(1 - 0.5qm')(1 - 0.5 qd')(1 - qe'), (qd, qm are similar), note that qd=qm=qt=0 at max retirement age, when qe' = 1
 # p  = 1 - qe - qt - qm - qd
 # We assume qe, qt, qd, qm are directly available from data.     

# Assign parameters to the local function call.
