# Restrictions on current version
# 1. r.max must be in the range [55, 65]
# 2. v.yos <= r.max - r.min
# Note: The restrictions above are removed in current version since we use single retirement age and set r.min = r.max.

  ## 1. Benefit structure

  # 4). Employer's contribution ERC is determined by one of the three contribution rules
  # 5). Total contribution: C = EEC + ERC
  # Potential problem:
  # Employee contribution as % of salary. For now this rate is fixed in all period, even 
  # employee contribution is greater than normal costs and results in negative employer contribution.

  s.year = 10,    # amortization period for unexpected investment gain/loss
  
  
  # Parameters for asset smoothing method 2 (TPAF)
  # Note: actuarial asset value of current year is a weighted average of expected actuarial asset value and market asset value. 
  EAA_0    = 200,   # expected market value at 0. Set to the same value as MA_0 by default.
  init_EAA = "MA",  # "MA" for the same value as MA; "EAA" for preset value of inital EAA.

  ## 7.  Growth rate of workforce
  wf_growth   = 0.00,    # growth rate of the size of workforce. For now, new entrants are equally distributed across all entry ages.
